Scripts for installing TopX Free Apps and Games from Playstore

#Prequisite:

1. Playstore must be configured with valid google account.
2. Device should have enough free space for the apps you wish to install.
3. Account recovery option for playstore should be set, this is just because if it is not set playstore always prompts to set it after each app installation , that is not handled by these scripts.

-python InstallTopXFreeApps.py N 

Where N is number of Top Free APPs you wish to install from playstore

#To Install TOP X Free Games:

-python InstallTopXFreeGames.py N 

Where N is number of Top Free Games you wish to install from playstore
